			<h2>Gene Guru Terms of Service</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
			<em><p>Last Updated: April 25, 2014</p></em>
			<p>Thank you for using Gene Guru! 
These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and access to the services, client 
software and websites ("Services") provided by Gene Guru Corporation. Our Privacy 
Policy explains how we collect and use your information while our Acceptable Use 
Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, 
you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and to review our Privacy Policy 
(below) and Acceptable Use policies. If you're using our Services for an organization, 
you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization. </p>
			<h3>Your stuff &amp; your permissions</h3>
			<p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your DNA, name and 
personal information, contacts etc. ("Your Stuff"). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms 
don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to 
offer the Services.</p>
			<p>Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document 
previews, email organization, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These 
and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. 
You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted 
third parties we work with. </p>
			<p>If you choose to use your raw DNA data file, Gene Guru will gladly export the file if 
you have securely logged in and request it. Furthermore, this information can be 
obtained by you if you request it through our API. </p>
			<p><strong>Long story short: You own your stuff, we do not. We will never share your data with 
anyone, ever.</strong></p>
			<h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
			<p>You're responsible for your conduct, Your Stuff and you must comply with our 
<strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>. Please do not attempt to infringe on our intellectual property 
rights, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.</p>
			<p>We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our 
<strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>, although we are under no obligation to do so. </p>
			<p>Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don't have 
access to it, and keep your account information current. </p>
			<p>Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the 
age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13. </p>
			<p><strong>Long story short: Use the service as intended and you’ll benefit from genetics for the 
rest of your life. </strong></p>
			<h3>Software</h3>
			<p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("Software"), which may 
update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a 
limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely 
to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered 
under an open source license, we'll make that license available to you and the 
provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the 
following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or 
decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p>
			<h3>Your Stuff</h3>
			<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. 
These Terms don't grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others' 
content in the Services, Gene Guru trademarks, logos and other brand features. We 
welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any 
obligation to you.</p>
			<h3>Accounts</h3>
			<p>Billing. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when 
required to do so. </p>
			<p>No Refunds. You may cancel your Gene Guru account at any time but you will not be 
issued a refund.</p>
			<p>You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to 
suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For 
example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you are not 
complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us 
legal liability, or disrupt the operations of Gene Guru in any way. </p>
			<h3>Services "AS IS"</h3>
			<p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't 
guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GENE GURU 
MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE 
SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don't allow the disclaimers in 
this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>
			<p><strong>Long story short: There is nothing guaranteed other than receiving the Gene Guru 
Action Plan you paid for.</strong></p>
			<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
			<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GENE 
GURU BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, 
EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE OR 
DATA, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT GENE GURU 
HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF 
A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY 
FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER 
OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO GENE GURU FOR THE PAST 12 
MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states don't allow the types of 
limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. </p>
			<p><strong>Long story short: You absolve Gene Guru of almost any claims. </strong></p>
			<h3>Resolving Disputes</h3>
			<p><em>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without 
needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Gene Guru, you agree to 
try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@geneguru.me. We'll try to 
resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved 
within 15 days of submission, you or Gene Guru may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
			<p><em>We Both Agree To Arbitrate.</em> You and Gene Guru agree to resolve any claims 
relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except 
as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. </p>
			<p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by 
clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first accepting these 
Terms.</p>
			<p>Arbitration Procedures. The American <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/home;jsessionid=lCcyTbJhYNgsmzwv4fZQv112k93nFhkJSDL9TmZ4B0Y4KnnymQ6G!-429404097?_afrLoop=1637832708003683&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null">Arbitration Association</a> (AAA) will administer 
the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary 
Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United 
States County where you live or work, Cambridge, MA or any other location we 
agree to.</p>
			<p>Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration 
fees. Gene Guru will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you 
receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve 
the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Gene Guru will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your 
claim is frivolous. </p>
			<p><em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. Either you or Gene Guru may assert claims, if 
they qualify, in small claims court in Cambridge, MA or any United States county 
where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to 
stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement 
(for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first 
engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. </p>
			<p><em>No Class Actions.</em> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and 
may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or 
representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general 
actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed. </p>
			<p><em>Judicial forum for disputes.</em> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not 
to apply to you or your claim, you and Gene Guru agree that any judicial proceeding 
(other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of 
Middlesex County. Both you and Gene Guru consent to venue and personal 
jurisdiction there.</p>
			<h3>Controlling Law</h3>
			<p>These Terms will be governed by Massachusetts law except for its conflicts of laws 
principles.</p>
			<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
			<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Gene Guru with 
respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other 
prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the 
subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights</p>
			<h3>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment </h3>
			<p>Gene Guru's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If 
a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain 
in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as 
closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and 
any such attempt will be void. Gene Guru may assign its rights to any of its affiliates 
or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the 
Services.</p>
			<h3>Modifications</h3>
			<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current 
version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify 
you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. </p>
